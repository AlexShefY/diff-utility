    There was, indeed, one of us who hesitated and did not want to fall into line. That was Joseph Behm, a
plump, homely fellow. And perhaps more of us thought as he did, but no one could very well stand out, because at that time even
one’s parents were ready with the word “coward”; no one had the vaguest idea what we were in for. The
wisest were just the poor and simple people. They knew the war to be a misfortune, whereas those who were
better off, and should have been able to see more clearly what the consequences would be, were beside
themselves with joy.

    In the dressing station there is great activity: it reeks as ever of carbolic, pus, and sweat. We are
accustomed to a good deal in the billets, but this makes us feel faint. We ask for Kemmerich. He lies in a
large room and receives us with feeble expressions of joy and helpless agitation. While he was unconscious
someone had stolen his watch.

    Strange to say, Behm was one of the first to fall. He got hit in the eye during an attack, and we left him
lying for dead. We couldn’t bring him with us, because we had to come back helter-skelter. In the afternoon
suddenly we heard him call, and saw him crawling about in No Man’s Land. He had only been knocked
unconscious. Because he could not see, and was mad with pain, he failed to keep under cover, and so was
shot down before anyone could go and fetch him in.

    Naturally we couldn’t blame Kantorek for this. Where would the world be if one brought every man to
book? There were thousands of Kantoreks, all of whom were convinced that they were acting for the best—
in a way that cost them nothing.
